                              Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who acquired my technical skills through college, coding bootcamps, YouTube, and LaunchCode - a nonprofit coding bootcamp.

                              I enjoy learning new technologies, applying them in real-world scenarios, and building projects that anyone can use. My current full-stack stack includes Java with Spring Boot, JavaScript with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, and PostgreSQL or MySQL for data persistence.

                              I thrive in collaborative environments because they give me opportunities to learn more, share ideas, and challenge myself to improve on area's I am not familiar with.
